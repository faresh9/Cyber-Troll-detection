i only have one piece of advice for all that support hamas you can show your solidarity with them by going to gaza and be with them
this is why israel says the un is hamas they try to deliver basic aid to kids and tell the world when israel turns them around and this is just a small fraction of the genocide israel and the us are perpetrating in gaza right now ig link
the north has been completely cleared out and is burning ripe for invasion dawning of the end of the occupational state very soon inshaallah
if you are supposedly going through a genocide you are in no position to make special demands if hamas is making demands and therefore rejecting the offered ceasefire then they dont seem to be in a desperate situation
for the genocide apologists the ceasefire terms the us is imposing are ones which disarm palestinians and leave them at the permanent mercy of a zionist army that would continue to steal palestinian land and imprison torture and execute palestinians with impunity

there are no angels here but not really parity of motive or behavior either if all palestinians forswore violence altogether even in selfdefense they would find millions of friends in israel if the jews of israel forswore it on those terms theyd all be dead in a month
america tolerates israels bad behavior not because israel or duh jews rule america but because america wants to dominate eurasia and israel is a huge american military base in eurasia its that simple

hamas firing rockets all over israel there will be silence from all those calling for a ceasefire because they are liars and racists their goal is not peace its to protect the rapist islamic fundamentalists hamas from attack and help them to kill jews
the goal is ethnic cleansing not defeating hamas the western politicalmedia class adamantly insists on continuing to frame israels actions in gaza solely as a war against hamas hamas isnt the target its the excuse exactly
imagine what the israelis would be doing if the palestinians were using their same war tactics imagine palestinians were systematically flattening their cities with bombs and engaging in intentional mass killing of civilians including women and children if the palestinians

killed 178 palestinians in one day of indiscriminate bombardment of north and south israel told gazans to leave from north to south and then from khan younes in the south to rafah but bombed all of gaza including rafah
its insane just how many israeli leaders have called for the ethnic cleansing of the palestinians in the gaza amp the west bank we now know thats the plan for gaza but a large of israeli society has embraced this idea for decades shocking but not surprising
keep in mind israel killed 14 palestinians in the west bank during this truce including 2 children before the hamas attack in jerusalem but to people like ritchie israel killing palestinians is never breaking ceasefires because they have no regard for palestinian life

the palestinian right to resistance has become so taboo in western discourse that anyone who fights back is just branded hamas imagine if an occupying army was slaughtering your relatives and invading your homes most people would find it selfevident and right to justify
btw the temporary ceasefire ended and israel didnt waste any time going back to bombing the people of gaza amp continuing their massacre

in the last 24 hours israel has managed to kill 5 hamas militants and more than 1000 innocent civilians therefore this is not a war it is genocide

went back to reread the ruling in light of this as the threshold for urgency has been met israel has been ordered to cease to do the following things immediately and to stop its military from doing so too a killing members of the group palestinians b causing serious
all i can hear is bla bla bla bla did the court order a ceasefire no why because there is no genocide they did however order hamas to immediately release the hostages because that is a crime against humanity consequently hamas has been found guilty and israel gets
this is an excellent statement by ihrc the decision amount to saying that israel has a right to wage war in gaza but that it should take care to ensure it does not commit genocidal acts falls far short of what is required to rein in the apartheid regime
short of a ceasefire is far from completely accurate israel has been ordered to immediately stop killing or seriously harming palestinians in effect an order for a ceasefire against the two million civilians in palestine what the court actually said the
the international court of justice in its ruling today essentially says that israel is not committing genocide that its war against hamas is in fact legal according to international law and its giving israel a green light to continue the operation in gaza with restrictions
literally everyone including zionists themselves admit that whats happening in palestine is a genocide but no one not even the fucking lcj want to call for a ceasefire the israel impunity is so scary and dystopian like what the fuck is happening in the fuckass world
no ceasefire order but the icj has ordered that stops killing they wont stop killing palestinians if they dont stop the bombing slaughter the western countries supporting the genocide must end that support now or are they going to ignore the icj
fyi the international court of justice did not call for a ceasefire let alone rule that is guilty of genocide but it did demand the immediate and unconditional release of the hostages held by yet to see that widely reported
breaking icj issues provisional order to israel and all parties to the genocide convention to cease and desist historical rule
a partial victory at the hague but a real one the outline of facts was damning and this court is obviously minded to find genocide when the substantive case comes forward no direct order to ceasefire but israel explicitly instructed to obey the genocide convention on not
remember that opposing a ceasefire is supporting the genocide of innocent people
provisional victory against genocide in gaza the icj have determined that the actions of israel requires a provisional ruling due to the imminent danger posed to the people of gaza thus israel must end all actions that endangers the people of gaza this ruling is binding
the order is clear the killing and destruction in gaza must stop urgent humanitarian assistance must be provided to prevent more suffering hostages must be released immediately with such death and destruction we will continue to call for an immediate ceasefire
the icj ordered israel to take all measures to prevent genocide in occupied gaza and facilitate entry of aid but stopped short of ordering a ceasefire

todays icj ruling update 1 no genocide by israel 2 yes israel can continue defensive war against hamas no ceasefire a lot of other issues but this is what it boils down to
i see some pro palestinians are trying to spin this ruling as if its a historic victory for palestine and a historic defeat for israel i dont know how anyone can claim not calling for an end to military action is a victory and ultimately that is the headline no ceasefire
unwavering just two days ago your military shot a palestinian civilian waving a white flag in the safe zone the idf has made a mockery of international law with its conduct in the last 111 days you have killed palestinians everywhere in their homes churches mosques
from what i understand the court didnt order a ceasefire but ordered israel to prevent the commission of acts that fall within the definition of genocide which includes the killing of members of the group and causing serious bodily harm
its rather that hamas is not a state actor and not a party to the icj and so the icj cannot tell them to abide by a ceasefire so it would effectively be telling israel alone to stop fighting hamas but what matters here is no the hamasisrael war its the genocide and the icj
icj clearly said palestinians are protected group under genocide convention and israel should immediately stop killing or harming palestinians they didnt use the term ceasefire but the intent is the same i dont get the pessimism
no ceasefire no justice the icj failed to mandate an immediate ceasefire meaning the zionist israeli entity will continue dropping indiscriminate bombs on the gaza strip murdering innocent palestinians it will also continue making a mockery out of intl law and human rights
what a dishonest headline calling for a ceasefire was never in the purview of the court because hamas is not a un member the icj very clearly ruled that israel is killing innocent civilians and that they must take action to stop
an important win for israel

just to be clear israel did not win today but there is so much more that the icj could have done we needed to hear the word ceasefire given all the horrific situation and the genocidal acts inflicted on the palestinians which the icj is well aware of we expected nothing

people sometimes you have to take yes for an answer everything worth getting from this court in legal terms we got dont get hung up about the word ceasefire israel has been ordered to stop its genocide
we shouldnt be surprised the international court of justice didnt order a complete ceasefire since hamas wasnt a party to the proceedings but it went as far as it could to order israel to refrain from acts that could contribute to plausible genocide
the icj just allowed israel to legally kill 100000 more palestinians all else is meaningless rhetoric this is a bad failure for any pretence of international order the vague promise of somewhere in the future a genocide may be found to have happened is a poison pill we must
the international court of justice did not order israel to stop its campaign to fight hamas or withdraw from gaza there was no call for a ceasefire the october 7 war would end tomorrow if hamas surrendered and released the hostages
