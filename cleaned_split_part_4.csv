there is no justification for cutting off internet and communication access israel is preventing palestinians in gaza from contacting each other and the outside world while simultaneously ramping up its bombing campaign we cannot be silent or look away

israel has dropped the equivalent of a nuclear bomb on 22 besieged palestinians amp achieved zero of its military objectives this is not a war on hamas but a war on palestinians amp particularly children who comprise 50 of pop 3000 children murdered in 3 weeks palestine
why the gaza ground invasion is necessary what people need to understand from israels perspective is that this is a cost calculation until october 7th the calculation in israel was that israel was that the country was better off putting up with occasional attacks and
will the government come out and condemn this and show their support for the palestinian people as they did with israel
its never too late to learn human lifes depend on this and i can not stress this enough this not a war this is ethenic cleansing call it what its wording matters this is gencoide and unless people speaking up about this ppl of gaza will continue to suffer

you only knock out communications to ensure no one can show what youve done israel has cut palestine off from the world with most of the worlds approval generations condemned to die in darkness because our governments refuse to force a ceasefire
palestine will be free from the river to the sea doesnt call for the death of jews but the liberation of all palestinians living in that area meaning full political and social rights for all palestinians everyone having an equal vote and equal power for selfdetermination
it is a bit odd that the people who keep reminding israel to follow international law which it is having layers of lawyers in the idf checking the legality of every air strike aimed at hamas have so little to say about hostage taking grave breach of geneva iv
