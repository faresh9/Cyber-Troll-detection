israel has forced palestinians in gaza to move to south and now just started to bomb there what theyve been doing is not defensing themselves but ethnic cleansing why do we have to overlook such a terrible thing before our eyes even though having the power to stop it
this is the problem with your narrative there are 2 innocent parties the hostages and the civilians you make note of the 2 freed hostages but make no mention of the near 100 civilians killed 100 killed 100 murdered but you dont mention them because they dont register

after displacing 14m palestinians from the north to the south and from the south to rafah israel now wants to continue butchering palestinians until they are pushed from rafah into egypt this was never about hamas this is was always about ethnic cleansing native palestinians
the genocidal israeli regime holds over 10000 palestinians hostage in its prisons including thousands of children they torture and rape them and its an occupation regime so hamas is justified in killing millions of israelis to secure their release
israel is currently bombing the last safe place in gaza israel is committing genocide israel is murdering innocent civilians right now israel is occupying palestine israel is blowing up children right now all while the usa watches football free palestine

a free palestine is a myth if hamas remains in power its ideology will not be erased from peoples minds and will continue to infect new generations and the cycle of violence will follow one after another idealizing an independent state especially now is as utopian as it is
there are different aspects to gaza which make its situation different like the onset famine having no shelter to hide in ie bomb shelters and having no defence force to speak of no hamas isnt one and did instigate the conflict to reach this excessive violence
but if hamas truly does care about the palestinian people its heartening to see that the same cleareyed realism that guided us in iraq is still being brought to bear in our middle eastern foreign policy
hamas twierdzi e rozmowy o rozejmie zakoczyy si niepowodzeniem poniewa izrael nie obieca zakoczenia wojny i wyjcia wojska z gazy zapomnia wspomnie o zakadnikach i kto napad na izrael negocjowa zawsze warto ale chyba ju nie w tym przypadku czas to skoczy

being jewish is everything to be proud of weve endured and survived more throughout our glorious history than almost any other group of humans combined that doesnt mean were better it just means we have the right to be equal regardless of how many throughout history have
its possible to oppose the killing of innocent civilians in gaza and still care for the safety of israeli hostages one can worry about israelis who were evacuated from their homes after oct 7 and still be horrified by the conditions in which so many are currently living in gaza
it also points to why its not enough to just wear a vague pin or say you want to ceasefire its also why we need to call the eradication of gazans a genocide and name the perpetrators not doing so keep us collectively in the zone of interest
this issue is 76 years old i have spent 40 years embroiled in it one way or the other the word liberation has only been used in the context of the elimination of the juice also hamas has an 87 approval rating in gaza and 90 in the west bank so exactly who are we talking
the israeli narrative is that hamas is not interested in a deal now that it has stopped negotiations this is incorrect israel may find it unacceptable but their position has remained consistent full stop to war withdrawal of idf and return of displaced to northern gaza

hasans solicitor taher gulamhussein of said while the world is rightfully focussed on the israeli genocide in gaza it is critical to understand that by virtue of its being an apartheid state israels oppression extends to any palestinians under its control and
all states in the region are ethnostate so im not sure why youd single out israel for this and israel wasnt initially established through war it was established through land purchases mainly from the ottoman empire the war and aggression generally came from the arabs
since 1967 israel has exercised full control of gazas 43km coastline and territorial waters blocking ships from reaching the city gaza seaport is the only mediterranean port closed to shipping because of israeli colonization and continued destruction
the reason now that hamas cannot back down from its conditions for a ceasefire is precisely because palestinians in gaza have been made to pay such an unfathomably enormous price that anything less will absolutely be seen as a betrayal and waste obviously
hasan said this is a victory not just for me but for all palestinians living under the apartheid israeli regime without even having to step into court the uk government has now accepted that the palestinian struggle for freedom should not just be limited to gaza and the west
the fact that zionists are trying to twist his words as well is incredibly disturbing seriously my only complaint was him putting israelis before palestinians or centering israelis at all but you can definitely tell he put a lot on the line for that speech
this is the most victim mentality cry baby post glazer said not in our name and thats not what our ancestors stood for and hes right ceasefire now and stop the illegal occupation as well as the settlements give palestinians a state and hamas will cease to exist
as long as the gaza war continues the risk of terrorist attacks within israel will be critical idf kills wouldbe suicide bomber en route to carry out attack in israel
