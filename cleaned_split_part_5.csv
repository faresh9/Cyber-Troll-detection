they cant even pretend theyre after hamas with this hospital hamas doesnt exist in the west bank palestinian settlements
a ceasefire is just the first step to the release of hostages the end of the siege of gaza and a just and lasting peace the next step is a process of dialogue between the people of israel and the people of palestine this requires facilitating a conversation
we have been fed a false narrative for decades basically every point in this narrative is false and its time to debunk it we cant let generations believe and die for lies 1 there was a state called palestine 2 jews came from europe to palestine amp england helped them

it doesnt anyone can interpret anything any way they like we are going back to rationalizing banning free speech why can no one ever be principled i hate it
one of the many many things that sucks about all this is knowing that when there is a violent retaliation for israels actions in gaza which kills israeli civilians israel will look up with bambieyed innocence and say what did we ever do to them we just want to live in

unrwa has just confirmed it this is the biggest displacement of palestinians since 1948 it wont go without an answer apartheid israels brand name is now what apartheid south africa was in the 1980s
bonus israel started secular and has growing religious and messianic segments palestine started secular but embraced radical islam the result is that israel maintains isolated provocative settlements while palestine adopted martyrdom antisemitism and intransigence
its a matter of time before israel starts carpet bombing the south of gaza as it claims that hamas leaders have moved south to khan younis the israeli colonial forces have dropped leaflets on the area telling gazans to flee this is systemic and premeditated ethnic cleansing
lets demo in the spirit of retaliation israel should deliberately kill every palestinian as if they are are affiliated with are related to or know the whereabouts of any members of hamas but with the primary motive of destroying palestine
hamas probably would do that calculating that a long enough cease fire will give them a chance to regroup give the entire gaza strip a chance to breathe make renewing fighting politically costly for israel foment a political crisis in israel that could see bibi ousted
how distraught would the people of gaza who have lost everything be if they found out all these people whove been protesting all month started making ceasefire their only demand push back against this cooptation any calls for ceasefire must come with demands for liberation

the bulldozing of the yasser arafat monument in the tulkarm refugee camp in the west bank and now this i think is reinforcing netanyahus rejection of any possibility of the palestinian authority being reinstalled in gaza its a war against palestine not hamas
its not a shibboleth its the clear material demand of 18 un agencies oxfam msf amnesty international and all of palestinian society for a reasonbecause ceasefires between israel and hamas have a very specific historical precedent and are a minimal ask given the death toll
the tens of thousands of deaths the 9995 civilian casualty rate uncounted and untreatable wounded arrogant and naked lies as justification is enough but the constant aggression toward symbols of any kind of future for palestinian life in gaza is evidence of genocidal intent

also it bears repeatingif there ever is a ceasefire the death toll as a result of this period of time will continue to rise forget that israel controlled the water supply and electricity and was already killing them that way before october 7ththe results of these past 6
when its a ploy to ethnically cleanse them from their land like the last time israel made them refugees most gazans are already refugees then yes its ethnic cleansing no one believes theyll ever be let back in you dont either
i think its being underdiscussed that even with an instant ceasefire and the immediate withdrawal of the idf and a further good ending action has been delayed for so long that all the hospitals have been bombed and an enormous percent of the housing stock is rubble
i want to be clear on this richie i am not pro hamas i am not pro netanyahu i am against the atrocities carried out by both both use misinformation i am pro not blowing the crap out of each other particularly civilians i hope you know me well enough to know this

i guess the issue is they never just mean the west bank when they say that but ill have to think about it before i come to a conclusion
this is israels genocide plan claim there is a hamas target then annihilate the area with its people homes hospitals schools streets bakeries and all infrastructure finish up the north claim your target moved south go south rinse and repeat until there is no gaza
not when they are occupied lebanese and palestinian lands it is called decolonization

you dont know your basic facts gaza and west bank are different places though both are illegally occupied territory by israel in violation of international law perhaps that is the source of your confusion

by declaring khan younes in southern gaza as hamas real command and control centre and warning residents to flee further south to the safe zone in almawasi israel is recreating refugees out of gazas preexisting refugee community 70 of gazans are refugees 24

if a temporary ceasefire is going to happen keep in mind that the israeli military in addition to constantly lying shoots amp kills palestinians it has forced to flee through a safe corridor and then bombs them at the location theyve been told to flee to
so hamas did not go with the intent of murdering civilians but instead murdering israeli occupation forces which is a legitimate response to apartheid and israel opened fire on their own people whose deaths theyd later use to manufacture consent for genocide no surprises
hamas has offered to return the hostages in return for their own but israhell refused even some of the hostages speak up about hamas treating them well while videos of palestinian hostages are tortured and humiliated can people shut up abt the hostages
there will be a ceasefire as soon as hamas releases the hostages lays down their weapons and surrenders

the right way to be understanding the current war between israel and hamas in the regional context is that the consensus formed in khartoum in 1967 with the famous 3 nos no peace no negotiation and no recognition of israel is largely dead in sunni arab countries

according to this deranged resolution palestinians have to approve of their own ethnic cleansing amp the wiping out of hundreds of their towns amp villages to facilitate the creation of the state of israel or else be considered antisemitic

conveniently though most out of wilful ignorance they continue with the lie that the current war in gaza began on october 7th 2023 the nakba ethnic cleansing of 1948 continues in blood to this day but proportionally few give a damn or have courage enough to consider that
theyre taunting him all that ai surveillance tech and 73 journalists killed later and im supposed to believe they arent targeting specific groups of people in their ethnic cleansing project
